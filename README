README - Luke Lovett

My scene is pretty simple right now--- just a few spheres and a couple of
planes. I'm working on building a room out of the planes: one for the floor, and
the other for a wall. My ray tracer implements both reflection and refraction.

I have adhered to the Honor Code in this assignment.
