README - Luke Lovett

My scene is a red "sun" surrounded by a configurable number of green "planets,"
which are highly reflective and appear to be made out of glass. The far wall is
a dull brown, while the floor is a green mirror. The program takes quite awhile
to render the image (on the order of 20 seconds), so be assured that it's not
entering an infinite loop.

I have adhered to the Honor Code in this assignment.
